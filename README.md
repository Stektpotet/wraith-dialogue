WraithDialogue
===============

WraithDialogue is an entirely free program written in Java that allows writers to easily create nonlinear conversations. It'll also allow for saved characters, meaning that you'll be able to have a repository of all the story's characters.

The program is currently being developed for the project "Lands of Loriana"; it'll later be modified for public use.
